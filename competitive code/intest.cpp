Enormous Input Test Problem Code: INTEST

All submissions for this problem are available.
The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using
to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the
enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process
at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

Input

The input begins with two positive integers Åˆ k (n, k <= 10^7). The next n
lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 10^9, each.

Output

Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are
divisible by k.

Example
