## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
competitive-programming/
│
├── [PlatformName1]/
│   ├── [DifficultyLevel1]/
│   │   ├── problem1/
│   │   └── problem2/
│   └── [DifficultyLevel2]/
│       └── problem3/
│
├── [PlatformName2]/
│   └── [DifficultyLevel1]/

└── README.md
```

- **PlatformName1, PlatformName2**: Name of the competitive programming platforms (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces).
- **DifficultyLevel1, DifficultyLevel2**: The difficulty level of the problems (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **problem1, problem2**: Directories or files for specific problems, containing solutions and explanations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
