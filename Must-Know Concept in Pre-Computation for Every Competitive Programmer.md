## Must-Know Concept in Pre-Computation for Every Competitive Programmer

### Introduction
In competitive programming, mastering the concept of pre-computation can significantly optimize your solutions and make seemingly complex problems more manageable. Pre-computation allows you to prepare data or calculations in advance, which can then be used to answer multiple queries efficiently. This chapter will cover a medium-level problem that requires a unique pre-computation technique, often overlooked by many programmers. Understanding this method will not only help you solve the problem at hand but also equip you with a tool that is frequently applicable in various competitive programming challenges.

### Problem Overview
The problem we're discussing today falls under the category of array manipulation. The challenge involves performing a series of operations on an array of integers, where each operation updates a range of elements within the array by adding a specific value. The key is to perform these operations efficiently, especially when the size of the array and the number of operations are large.

The array has `n` elements, initially set to zero, and you are given `m` operations. Each operation specifies a range `[l, r]` and a value `v` to be added to each element in that range. After all operations, you need to determine the maximum value in the array.

### Example Problem Statement
Given an array of size `n = 10^7` and `m = 10^5` operations, where each operation updates a subarray with a given value, how can you efficiently find the maximum value in the array after performing all operations?

### Naive Approach
A straightforward solution would be to iterate through the array and apply each operation directly. However, this approach would be highly inefficient due to the large constraints, resulting in a time complexity of O(n * m), which is impractical for large inputs.

### Optimized Approach Using Pre-Computation
To optimize the solution, we use a pre-computation technique known as the "difference array" method. This method allows us to perform range updates in constant time, thereby reducing the overall time complexity significantly.

#### Difference Array Concept
The difference array `D[]` is constructed such that:
- `D[l] += v` increments the value at the start of the range by `v`.
- `D[r + 1] -= v` decrements the value just after the end of the range by `v`.

Once all operations are applied to the difference array, we can reconstruct the original array by taking the prefix sum of `D[]`. The result is the array after all range updates, and finding the maximum value is a matter of iterating through this array once.

#### Implementation
```python
n = 10**7
m = 10**5
D = [0] * (n + 1)

# Apply each operation
for _ in range(m):
    l, r, v = map(int, input().split())
    D[l] += v
    if r + 1 <= n:
        D[r + 1] -= v

# Reconstruct the array and find the maximum value
max_value = 0
current_value = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    current_value += D[i]
    if current_value > max_value:
        max_value = current_value

print(max_value)
```

### Explanation
1. **Difference Array**: We maintain an auxiliary array `D[]` where each element `D[i]` represents the difference between the original array elements at indices `i` and `i-1`. By only updating the start and end points of the range in `D[]`, we effectively mark the changes that need to be applied across the array.
  
2. **Prefix Sum**: After applying all the operations, the original array is reconstructed by computing the prefix sum of `D[]`. This gives us the final values of the array after all operations.

3. **Maximum Value**: The final step is to traverse the reconstructed array to find the maximum value.

### Conclusion
This pre-computation technique using a difference array is a powerful tool in competitive programming. It turns what would have been an O(n * m) problem into an O(n + m) problem, making it feasible to solve within the given constraints. Understanding and applying such optimization techniques can give you a significant edge in competitive programming contests.
